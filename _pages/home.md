I am a master student at China Agricultural University, Beijing. My research is centered around the fascinating realm of soil microbiome dynamics, bioinformatics, and the intricate interplay between plants and their root systems.

My current investigations revolve around the **methanogenic food web thriving within paddy soils**, utilization meta-omics such as **metatranscriptomics**, **metagenomics**, and **metabolomics**. 
Omics-based approaches are powerful tools for unraveling the structural and functional responses of microbial communities in paddy soils to environmental perturbations, including drought, salt stress, extreme temperature, and biotic stress. My fervent passion lies in unraveling the intricate microbial interactions thriving in anoxic environments.

**Currently, I am actively seeking a distinguished Ph.D. position to further expand my scholarly pursuits.**
